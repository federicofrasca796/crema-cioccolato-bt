## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Commit convention

Commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
Commitizen has been implemented to help you (aka. me) follow this convention. [Learn more about Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

To have a guidance on properly formatted commit messages you (again, talking to myself here) should use:

```bash
git cz
# or
npm run commit-msg
```

Commitizen is configured to use the custom [cz-emoji-conventional](https://github.com/promet99/cz-emoji-conventional) adapter to achieve fancier commits. Emojis help in a sea of text afterall.
For a classic look switch to commitizen owned [cz-conventional-changelog](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-conventional-changelog) adapter.
