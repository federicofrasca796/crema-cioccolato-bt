## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Commit convention

Commits must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
Commitizen has been implemented to help you (aka. me) follow this convention. [Learn more about Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

To have a guidance on properly formatted commit messages you (again, talking to myself here) should use:

```bash
pnpm commit
# or, if you have commitizen installed globally on your machine:
git cz
```

Commitizen is configured to use the custom [cz-emoji-conventional](https://github.com/promet99/cz-emoji-conventional) adapter to achieve fancier commits. Emojis help in a sea of text afterall.
